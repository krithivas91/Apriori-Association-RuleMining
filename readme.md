Description

In this project I have implemented Apriori Algorithm to display all possible association rules for each transaction. Based on the user input value of the support and confidence, the algorithm mines the appropriate rules that satisfy the requirements.

This can be used to identify frequent itemsets and give out recommendations in a marketplace. 

I have used 5 databases in the form of text files to represent transactions.

Please refer documentation for the output screenshots to see how it works :)
